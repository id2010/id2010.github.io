    <h3><b>Lyrics:</b></h3>
    <pre>
        Watch the sunrise along the coast
        As we're both getting old
        I can't describe what I'm feeling
        And all I know is we're going home
        So please don't let me go, oh
        Don't let me go, oh-oh-oh
        And if it's right
        I don't care how long it takes
        As long as I'm with you
        I've got a smile on my face
        Save your tears, it'll be okay
        All I know is you're here with me
        Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
        Watch the sunrise as we're getting old, oh-oh
        I can't describe, whoa-oh
        I wish I could live through every memory again
        Just one more time before we float off in the wind
        And all the time we spent
        Waiting for the light to take us in
        Have been the greatest moments of my life
        I don't care how long it takes
        As long as I'm with you, I've got a smile on my face
        Save your tears, it'll be okay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
        Yeah, if with me
        Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
        I can't describe, oh, oh
